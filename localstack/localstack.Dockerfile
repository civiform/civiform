# Localstack tries to connect to the host specified
# by success_redirect_url upon successful upload of
# content to S3. When running on a local machine,
# this will be "localhost". Within the localstack
# container, this doesn't point to the Civiform
# container. In order to allow this to resolve,
# nginx is used as a reverse proxy to forward
# requests localhost:9000 requests to civiform:9000
# (accessible from Docker's internal networking).
# See https://github.com/seattle-uat/civiform/issues/2639.
