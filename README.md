# CiviForm

This repository focuses on addressing **Improved Error Messaging (Feature #8031)** when adding a program admin. The current error message is confusing when a program admin has not yet logged in to CiviForm, especially regarding the differences between a CiviForm Admin and a Program Admin. This update aims to provide clearer instructions and prevent confusion.

## Problem
When attempting to add a program admin before they've logged in to CiviForm, the current error message does not clearly explain:
- Why the program admin must log in first.
- The difference between CiviForm Admin, Program Admin, and general "admin accounts."
- That the user will not have access to anything until they are granted access to a program.

This is important because CiviForm Admin feedback from Arkansas has highlighted this issue as frustrating, though they have a workaround.

## Solution
We aim to implement a clearer error message that explains:
- The reason the program admin must log in first.
- The distinction between different admin roles.
- A notice that users wonâ€™t have access to programs until granted access.
