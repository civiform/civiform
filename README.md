# CiviForm

CiviForm aims to simplify the application process for benefits programs by re-using applicant data
for multiple benefits applications. It is being developed by Google.org in collaboration with the
City of Seattle.

Key features:

- No-code administration: admins can add new questions and programs using the UI without the need for custom code
- Multi-language support also through the admin UI
- Bulk data export with admin-defined privacy settings to preserve applicant privacy
- Trusted intermediary role to enable community based organizations to manage applications on behalf of clients
- Recursive data model: admins can define repeated and recursive questions for nested data such as asking for each address for each employer of each member of a household
