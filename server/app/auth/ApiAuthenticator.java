/**
 * Authenticator for API requests based on HTTP basic auth and backed by the {@link ApiKeyModel}
 * resource. Background: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication
 *
 * <p>When referenced by a request, {@code ApiKey}s are stored in the "api-keys" named cache, keyed
 * by their key ID. This allows controller code to load the key without the need for a subsequent
 * database query. This is necessary because pac4j creates profiles (which are what's made available
 * to controller code through the request object) in the next step, but we need the API key to
 * perform authentication (this step). The purpose of the cache is to avoid making multiple database
 * calls to retrieve the API key throughout the cycle of the request.
 *
 * <p>Note that at this layer, the request is authenticated, not authorized. All API requests that
 * reach a controller are already authenticated, but it is the controller's responsibility to check
 * that the resource being accessed is authorized for the request's API key.
 *
 * <p>The API key ID and secret are provided as the basic auth username and password, respectively.
 * To be valid, a request must reference a valid API key with its username credential, and further
 * that key must:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Not be retired.
 *   <li>Have an expiration date in the future.
 *   <li>Have a subnet that includes the IP address of the request.
 *   <li>Have a salted key secret that matches the salted password in the request's basic auth
 *       credentials.
 * </ul>
