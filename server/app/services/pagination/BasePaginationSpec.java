/**
 * Abstracts different kind of pagination strategies.
 *
 * <p>PaginationSpecs come in 2 major flavors: random acess paging and sequential paging.
 *
 * <p>Random Access Paging: requires no knowledge of the last row that was displayed in a previous
 * page. This spec requires reading from storage the rows up to the offset and the reading the limit
 * number of rows for the query result, performance degrades as higher pages are queried for.
 * Usually used in an user-facing interface.
 *
 * <p>Sequential paging: requires knowledge of the last row returned by the previous page to
 * retrieve the next page. This spec has constant performance for any page in the range, but can
 * only access pages in sequence. Usually used for export functions and API retrieve methods.
 *
 * <p>Implementations of this interface are: PageNumberPaginationSpec,
 * RowIdSequentialAccessPaginationSpec, and SubmitTimeSequentialAccessPaginationSpec.
 *
 * <p>PageNumberPaginationSpec: sorts by submit time, is a random access paging spec. Recommended
 * for user facing views.
 *
 * <p>RowIdSequentialAccessPaginationSpec: sorts by row id, is a sequential access paging spec.
 * Recommended for API methods.
 *
 * <p>SubmitTimeSequentialAccessPaginationSpec: sorts by submit time, is a sequential access paging
 * spec. Recommended for CSV/JSON export methods.
 *
 * <p>Usage:
 *
 * <p>During query build-up for a list of Models, apply the pagination spec before calling
 * findPagedList.
 *
 * <p>Exmaple: ... PagedList<Foo> pagedQuery = paginationSpec.apply(query).findPagedList(); ...
