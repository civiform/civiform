# NOTE! This is not the default messages file - please add all messages to the file named "messages"
#
# This file is intentionally empty; Play falls back missing keys to the `messages` source strings file.
# Since `messages` and this file are both English, we can allow all en_US keys to fall back to
# keys in `messages`; this reduces duplication in our i18n files.
