Usage: bin/run-browser-test-env [options]

Run a local civiform environment for the browser tests to exercise.

Options:

--ci    Run the environment in CI mode. Removes caching for SBT builds and
        redirects log statements to a .dockerlogs file. Defaults to off.

--aws   Use the AWS emulator (Localstack) for simulating cloud services,
        cannot be used with --azure flag. This is the default.

--azure Use the Azure emulator (Azurite) for simulating cloud storage for file
        upload and download. Also use localstack, since we need that for SES.

--local Set BASE_URL to http://localhost:9999 to enable running
