# Run browser tests from within the civiform-browser-test container. We map
# full browser-test local directory to the container so that it uses local changes.
# Additionally we map node_modules to a separate volume so that it doesn't
# conflict with node_modules created locally.
# Mapping /ms-playwright directory to a volume because it contains browsers that
# were downloaded during `yarn install` by playwright. It has to be remain
# between runs to avoid extra fetching.
