# Upon a successful test run (exit code zero), we also
# assert that SBT actually ran the test suite by evaluating
# whether a well-known test name exists in the set of
# evaluated test targets. Note that moving / deleting
# MessageKeyTest will cause this to fail. If that happens,
# a new target can be used.
# This serves as a regression test for
# https://github.com/seattle-uat/civiform/pull/2459.
