# PDF to CiviForm

This is a prototype transforming an input PDF containing government forms to civiform json.  
Relevant documentation and active work items are captured in this epic: [https://github.com/civiform/civiform/issues/9967](https://github.com/civiform/civiform/issues/9967)

## How to run

To run the prototype:

- Make sure you have your Gemini API key in `~/google_api_key`
- From `/workspaces/civiform/pdf-to-civiform`, run the following script from the command line:

  ```bash
  python pdf_to_civiform.py
  ```

- Launch `http://localhost:5000/` in your browser and upload a PDF file.

There are 3 output files generated in `~/pdf-to-civiform/`:

- `PREFIX-formated-<LLM model-used>.json` - intermediary JSON generated by LLM from the input PDF containing structural form information.
- `PREFIX-post-processed-<LLM model-used>.json` - post-processed JSON generated by LLM to adjust extracted field types.
- `PREFIX-civiform-<LLM model-used>.json` - containing JSON to be imported into CiviForm.

Import the generated CiviForm JSON (in `PREFIX-civiform.json`) into CiviForm using the "Import existing program" feature.
