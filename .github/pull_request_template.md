### Description

Please explain the changes you made here.

## Release notes

Remove this section if the feature is still under development or if title of the pull request can be used as the default release notes description. If more detail is needed to communicate to partners the scope of the PR's changes, use this release notes section (and remove this placeholder text).

When the Release engineer creates Release Notes, they will not look for this section for Under Development tagged PRs, and will use it if present for all other PRs included in the Release Notes.

### Checklist

#### General

- [ ] Added the correct label (see [docs](https://github.com/civiform/civiform/wiki/Technical-contribution-guide#adding-appropriate-labels) for more info): < feature | enhancement | bug | under-development | dependencies | infrastructure | ignore-for-release | database >
- [ ] Assigned to a specific person, `civiform/developers`, or a [more specific round-robin list](https://github.com/civiform/civiform/wiki/Technical-contribution-guide#adding-reviewers)
- [ ] Added an additional reviewer from `civiform/eng-admin` as FYI (if this PR includes functionality changes and neither you nor the primary reviewer is an admin)
- [ ] Removed the release notes section if the title is sufficient for the release notes description, or put more details in that section.
- [ ] Created unit and/or browser tests which fail without the change (if possible)
- [ ] Performed manual testing (Chrome and Firefox if it includes front-end changes)
- [ ] Extended the README / documentation, if necessary. For user-facing features, consider updating [the user docs](https://github.com/civiform/docs). For "under-the-hood" changes or things more relevant to developers, consider updating [the dev wiki](https://github.com/civiform/civiform/wiki).
- [ ] Ensured PII wasn't added to any new logs, unless it was guarded by `isDevOrStaging`

#### Database evolutions

- [ ] Assigned two reviewers
- [ ] Guarded against already existing resources using `IF NOT EXISTS` and `IF EXISTS`
- [ ] Downs created to undo changes in Ups
- [ ] Every comment in script should begin with -- and not # --- unless it denotes Ups or Downs. See [here](https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.9.x/Evolutions) for details.

- [ ] Update the model documentation in our [wiki](https://github.com/civiform/civiform/wiki/Database) if necessary
